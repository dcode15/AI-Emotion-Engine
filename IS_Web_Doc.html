<p><b>Title:</b> Learning Emotions:
    A Software Engine for
    Simulating Realistic
    Emotion in Artificial Agents</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> This paper outlines a software framework for the simulation of dynamic emotions
    in simulated agents. This framework acts as a domain-independent, black-box
    solution for giving actors in games or simulations realistic emotional reactions
    to events. The emotion management engine provided by the framework uses a
    modified Fuzzy Logic Adaptive Model of Emotions (FLAME) model, which lets
    it manage both appraisal of events in relation to an individual's emotional state,
    and learning mechanisms through which an individual's emotional responses to a
    particular event or object can change over time. In addition to the FLAME model,
    the engine draws on the design of the GAMYGDALA emotional engine for games.
    Evaluations of the model's behavior over a set of test cases are performed, with a
    discussion of the model's efficacy in different situations.</p>
